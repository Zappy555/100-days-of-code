<h3>Day 2: May 24th, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: I covered, 
* Function of functions (higher order functions)
* jQuery Documentation overview: light weight JavaScript library and not a framework. Easy to catch up with basic JS skills.
* html family tree and jQuery - the DOM (Document Object Model)
* DOM manipulation with jQuery {.next( ), .toggleClass( ) etc}

**Thoughts:** On some of the challenges such as if/else, I had to use the hint on FCC to check the solution.
