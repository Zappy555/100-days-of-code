<h3>Day 31: March 2nd, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: I covered 19 challenges in JavaScript including arrays, nested arrays, functions and loops.

**Thoughts:** On some of the challenges such as if/else, I had to use the hint on FCC to check the solution.

<h3>Day 32: March 3rd, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: More and more reading of the Eloquent Javascript. Did a few challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Will keep on keeping on...

<h3>Day 33: March 4th, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: Tried a few more challenges on Codecademy JS lectures. Also downloaded VELOCITY App, an awesome tool containing a HUGE reference/documentation repository of some 150+ current programming languages. 

**Thoughts**: Still trying to wrap my head around control structure in JS. Getting there slowly though.
