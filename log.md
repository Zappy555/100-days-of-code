<h3>Day 31: March 2nd, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: I covered 19 challenges in JavaScript including arrays, nested arrays, functions and loops.

**Thoughts:** On some of the challenges such as if/else, I had to use the hint on FCC to check the solution.

<h3>Day 32: March 3rd, 2018</h3>

**Today's Progress**: More and more reading of the Eloquent Javascript. Did a few challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
